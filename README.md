> Boilerplate to create React.js apps with Vite

## Which techs this boilerplate have in it?

This boilerplate is ready to be used by devs who want to start a new project using React.js, TypeScript and Jest with Vite.

## Main configurations

- React.js 18+ with TypeScript;
  - You can import "svgs" with `import { ReactComponent as MyIcon } from '@/assets/icon-path.svg'`;
  - You can import any other media (images, videos, etc) that is located inside `src` directory;
  - You can use absolute imports, using `@` as `src` directory like above;
- Eslint:
  - [Standard](https://standardjs.com/) with some modifications;
  - React Hooks and other React configurations with [eslint-config-react-app](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-react-app) (same used in Create React App);
- Automatic lint and type-checking with Husky before every commit.

## Usage

Install the dependencies:

```sh
yarn install or npm i
```

Run dev server:

```sh
yarn dev or npm run dev
```

You can run type-checking in watch mode in another terminal, if you may:

```sh
yarn type-check --watch
```

## Run tests

```sh
yarn test
```

## Production version

To generate the production version, you can run:

```sh
yarn build or npm build
```

All files you have to deploy will be located at the `dist` directory.

### Run production version locally

To check if everything will be ok in production before the deployment, you can run this command after `yarn build`:

```sh
yarn preview or npm preview
```
